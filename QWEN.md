# GSMG.IO 5 BTC Puzzle Challenge - Project Context

This directory contains research, data, and attempts related to solving the GSMG.IO 5 BTC puzzle challenge. The primary goal was to find the private key for the Bitcoin address `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe`.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around a multi-phase cryptographic puzzle. The `README.md` file provides a detailed walkthrough of the solved phases, key clues, and various methodological approaches attempted to derive the final private key. Despite extensive efforts, the puzzle remains unsolved.

Key files and their purposes:
- `README.md`: Main documentation detailing the puzzle, solved phases, clues, and attempted solution methods.
- `cosmic_duality.txt`, `cosmic_duality_full.txt`, `cosmic_full.txt`: Encrypted or encoded data files, likely from a later phase of the puzzle.
- `temp/cosmic_duality_content.txt`: Appears to contain raw HTML content, possibly from a webpage related to the "SalPhaseIon" and "Cosmic Duality" stages of the puzzle. It includes a large block of characters and a base64-like string.
- `temp/cosmic_duality.txt`: A truncated version of the main `cosmic_duality.txt`.
- `image.jpg`: The initial image from the first phase of the puzzle.

## Key Research Areas and Clues

Based on `README.md`, the main avenues of investigation included:
- Combining key phrases like `lastwordsbeforearchichoice`, `thispassword`, `matrixsumlist`, `enter`, `THEMATRIXHASYOU`, `HALF AND BETTER HALF`.
- Interpreting the "HALF AND BETTER HALF" clue through string manipulation and case changes.
- Matrix-related operations on phrases.
- Applying multiple hashing algorithms (SHA256, SHA1, MD5) and HMAC-SHA512.
- Binary and hexadecimal manipulations of phrases.
- Working with a set of seven derived passwords from earlier puzzle phases.
- Analyzing a chess position clue: `B5KR/1r5B/2R5/2b1p1p1/2P1k1P1/1p2P2p/1P2P2P/3N1N2 b - - 0 1`.
- Bitcoin-specific key derivation methods.
- Unconventional approaches like phrase inversion and metaphorical interpretations.

## Development Status

This is not an active software development project, but rather a research and cryptography challenge attempt. There are no build or run commands. The "development" process involved:
1.  Analyzing puzzle clues and phases documented in `README.md`.
2.  Attempting various combinations and transformations of key phrases and clues.
3.  Writing and testing Python scripts (conceptualized in `README.md`) to apply cryptographic functions and check potential private keys against the target Bitcoin address.
4.  Storing intermediate data and results in files like `cosmic_duality.txt` and `cosmic_full.txt`.

The project is currently in a halted state as the final solution to the puzzle has not been found.
